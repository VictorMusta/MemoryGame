# MemoryGame
Lil memory game i made in python a while ago, it does not have a readme so here we are:
##RUNNING
run "python3 -m memoryGame" to play, then enter "2" or "1" and then enter depending on if you have already seen the word or not.
##WARNING
There is a console clearing system after each type that will be triggered on linux but not on windows 
(you'll only get an error explaining that the bash doesnt recognize the "clear" command, its normal i have the flemme to implement a conditionnal clear system.)
